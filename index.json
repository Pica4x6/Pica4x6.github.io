Through a longitudinal analysis of political discourse in Parliament using Natural Language Processing (NLP), we calculate the likelihood of hate speech and we find significant changes in the frequency and intensity of inflammatory speeches made by politicians. Our findings suggest that hate speech is linked to higher voter mobilisation, indicating that such rhetoric may influence voter turnout and election dynamics. Furthermore, we show that since the rise of the extreme-right party in Parliament in 2019, that tendency has shifted, and parties that refrained from using hate speech tended to attract more voters, highlighting the potential electoral cost of employing divisive language. Additionally, we show how this party influenced others to escalate their rhetoric, increasing in some cases the likelihood of hate speech by around 200% in less than 5 years. This study contributes to understanding the use of hate speech by politicians in Parliament in polarising political discourse and marginalising minority groups.","tags":null,"title":"Breaking the silence: the rise of hate speech in Spanish politics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohamed Hashim Changrampadi","Magnus Almgren","Pablo Picazo-Sanchez","Ahmed Ali-Eldin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"3f7cc1bfa89ec55cda386ab112fc207d","permalink":"https://Pica4x6.github.io/publication/10-1145-3722041-3723098/","publishdate":"2025-08-31T07:16:20.935245Z","relpermalink":"/publication/10-1145-3722041-3723098/","section":"publication","summary":"Transformer-based models have emerged as a powerful solution for network traffic classification, achieving high accuracy by autonomously learning patterns in raw traffic data.

During training, a transformer-based model learns traffic patterns, which are then extracted using SHAP analysis to enhance the knowledge base of a signature-based IDS. In deployment, the IDS handles routine classifications, while only complex cases are escalated to the transformer model.

ChatGPT originated some controversy in academia since students can generate unique text for writing assessments being sometimes extremely difficult to distinguish whether it comes from ChatGPT or a person. In research, some journals specifically banned ChatGPT in scientific papers. However, when used correctly, it becomes a powerful tool to rewrite, for instance, scientific papers and, thus, deliver researchers' messages in a better way. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of the impact of ChatGPT in research. We downloaded the abstract of over 45,000 papers from over 300 journals from Dec 2022 and Feb 2023 belonging to different research editorials. We use four of the most known ChatGPT detection tools and conclude that ChatGPT played a role in around 10% of the papers published in every editorial, showing that authors from different fields have rapidly adopted such a tool in their research.","tags":null,"title":"Analysing the impact of ChatGPT in research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric Olsson","Benjamin Eriksson","Lukas Andersson","Pablo Picazo-Sanchez","Andrei Sabelfeld"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"b142089d9c4fc9e8eede42d6167e182e","permalink":"https://Pica4x6.github.io/publication/fake-x-2024/","publishdate":"2025-08-31T07:16:21.131421Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fake-x-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Browser extensions boost user experience on the web. Similarly to smartphone app stores, browsers like Chrome distribute browser extensions via their Web Store, enabling a thriving market of third-party developed extensions. The Web Store incorporates a user review system to help users decide which extensions to install. Unfortunately, the open nature of the review system is subject to reputation manipulation. As browser vendors fight reputation manipulation, attackers employ more sophisticated methods to stay under the radar. Focusing on fake reviews, we identify several techniques used by attackers: fake accounts, disjoint sets of fake accounts for different extensions, automation of generated reviews, and focusing on reviews rather than ratings. We present FakeX, a framework to detect fake reviews by focusing on inference from review metadata. FakeX employs five distinct methods, including temporal distribution analysis, relationship clustering, and ratio-based assessments, to unveil patterns indicative of fake reviews. Evaluation on over 1.7 million reviews reveals the effectiveness of FakeX in identifying hundreds of fake review campaigns. Furthermore, our investigation of these fake reviews uncovers 86 malicious extensions, ranging from data stealing to monetization attacks, impacting over 64 million users. In addition, we collaborate with Adblock Plus and Avast to demonstrate FakeX in action, expanding a seed list of newly detected malicious extensions to discover a further 16 malicious extensions with millions of users, where in some cases attackers tried to improve malicious code.","tags":["Browser Extensions","Fake Reviews","Web Security"],"title":"FakeX: A Framework for Detecting Fake Reviews of Browser Extensions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oscar Palmqvist","Johan Jiremalm","Pablo Picazo-Sanchez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"a2a2af3ea2680f94980976b2a3a2a5d2","permalink":"https://Pica4x6.github.io/publication/clef-2024/","publishdate":"2025-08-31T07:16:21.032847Z","relpermalink":"/publication/clef-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Political debates are vital in shaping public opinion and influencing policy decisions.

Distractor generation, a critical aspect of multiple-choice question creation, is often overlooked, yet it plays a crucial role in test quality. Generating appropriate distractors requires ensuring they are incorrect but related to the correct answer (semantically or contextually), are grammatically correct, and of similar length to the target word. While various languages have seen research in automatic distractor generation, Japanese has received limited attention.

However, ABE schemes lack the notion of obligations, which is common in Attribute-Based Access Control systems such as eXtensible Access Control Markup Language and Usage Control. Obligations are used to define and enforce extra constraints that happen before approving or denying an access request. In this paper, we propose Attribute-Based Encryption with enforceable OBligations (OB-ABE), a system for extending any classical ABE with enforceable obligations. Our system architecture has as core component trusted hardware enclaves, implemented with Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), used for enforcing obligations. We employ ProVerif to formally model OB- ABE and verify its main property called “enforceable obligations”, i.e., if a message is encrypted along with an obligation, then the message can be decrypted only after enforcing the attached obligation. OB-ABE has two more properties: (i) OB-ABE is a “conservative extension” of the underlying ABE scheme, preserving its security properties; (ii) OB-ABE is “backward compatible” in the sense that any ciphertext produced by an ABE scheme can be decrypted by its extended OB- ABE version, and moreover, a ciphertext produced by an OB-ABE scheme can be decrypted by its underlying ABE scheme provided that the ciphertext does not have obligations attached. We also implement in C using Intel SGX a prototype of an OB-ABE extending the well-known Ciphertext-Policy ABE.

This exposes servers that have to compute the hash functions at every login attempt for denial of service attacks and limits the range of devices that can provide a high level of password security. For example, constrained Internet of Things devices cannot run modern hash functions like Argon2.  In this work, we discuss client-side hashing as an alternative. We propose Clipaha, a client-side hashing scheme that provides high password security even on highly constrained server devices. Clipaha is robust to a broader range of attacks compared to previous work and covers important and complex usage scenarios. Our evaluation discusses critical aspects involved in client-side hashing. We also provide an implementation of Clipaha in the form of a web library and benchmark the library on different systems to understand its mixed JavaScript and WebAssembly approach's limitations.

Detailed measurements and communication of, e.g., consumption allows for remote billing, but also in finding problems in the distribution of power and overall to provide data to be used to plan future upgrades of the network. From a security perspective, a massive deployment of such Internet of Things (IoT) components increases the risk that some may be compromised or that collected data are used for privacy-sensitive inference of the consumption of households. In this paper, we investigate the privacy concerns regarding detailed readings of smart meters for billing purposes. We present Gridchain, a solution where households can opt-in to hide their consumption patterns and thus make Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) more challenging. Households form groups where they can trade real consumption among themselves to achieve reported consumption that would be resistant to NILM. Gridchain is built on a publish/subscribe model and uses a permissioned blockchain to record any trades, meaning that dishonest households can be discovered and punished if they steal from other households in the group or the electricity company in the end. We implement and release a proof-of-concept of Gridchain and use public datasets to allow reproducibility. Our results show that even if an attacker has access to the reported electricity consumption of any member of a Gridchain group, this reported consumption is significantly far from the actual consumption to allow for a detailed fingerprint of the household activities.","tags":["Privacy","Smart Grid","NILM"],"title":"Gridchain: An Investigation of Privacy for the Future Local Distribution Grid","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Eriksson","Pablo Picazo-Sanchez","Andrei Sabelfeld"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"020474dcc88e4ea3f5e80c5bc5c0ca73","permalink":"https://Pica4x6.github.io/publication/beneri-2022/","publishdate":"2025-08-31T07:16:22.116783Z","relpermalink":"/publication/beneri-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Browser extensions boost browsing experience by a range of features from automatic translation and grammar correction to password management, ad blocking, and remote desktops.

This paper identifies download patterns as a useful signal for analyzing browser extensions. We leverage machine learning for clustering extensions based on their download patterns, confirming at a large scale that many extensions follow strikingly similar download patterns. Our key insight is that the download pattern signal can be used for identifying malicious extensions. To this end, we present a novel technique to detect malicious extensions based on the public number of downloads in the Chrome Web Store. This technique fruitfully combines machine learning with security analysis, showing that the download patterns signal can be used to both directly spot malicious extensions and as input to subsequent analysis of suspicious extensions. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on a dataset from a daily crawl of the Web Store over 6 months to track the number of downloads. We find 135 clusters and identify 61 of them to have at least 80% malicious extensions. We train our classifier and run it on a test set of 1,212 currently active extensions in the Web Store successfully detecting 326 extensions as malicious solely based on downloads. Further, we show that by combining this signal with code similarity analysis, using the 326 as a seed, we find an additional 6,579 malicious extensions.

In this paper, we propose a methodology based on machine learning to automatically generate classifiers that can be used by an adversary to solve any distinguishing problem. We discuss the assumptions, a basic approach for improving the advantage of the adversary as well as a phenomenon that we call the “blind spot paradox” .

The acceptance of extensions in current browsers is unquestionable. For instance, Chrome's official extension repository has more than 63,000 extensions, with some of them having more than 10M users. When installed, extensions are pushed into an internal queue within the browser. The order in which each extension executes depends on a number of factors, including their relative installation times. In this paper, we demonstrate how this order can be exploited by an unprivileged malicious extension (i.e., one with no more permissions than those already assigned when accessing web content) to get access to any private information that other extensions have previously introduced. We propose a solution that does not require modifying the core browser engine, since it is implemented as another browser extension. We prove that our approach effectively protects the user against usual attackers (i.e., any other installed extension) as well as against strong attackers having access to the effects of all installed extensions (i.e., knowing who did what). We also prove soundness and robustness of our approach under reasonable assumptions.","tags":["Browser extensions","Chrome","Malware","Privacy","Web security"],"title":"After you, please: browser extensions order attacks and countermeasures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lara Ortiz-Martin","Pablo Picazo-Sanchez","Pedro Peris-Lopez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"91068e4624f2fef29c4c63dcc424fddd","permalink":"https://Pica4x6.github.io/publication/ortiz-2019-a/","publishdate":"2025-08-31T07:16:23.485756Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ortiz-2019-a/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years many authors have explored the use of biological signals for security issues. In the context of cardiac signals, the use of Inter-Pulse Interval (IPI) values as a source of entropy is one of the most widely used solutions in the literature.

In this article, we demonstrate that the choice of the IPI bits used to date may not be the most correct (e.g., the combination of bits 2638 are much better that the common assumed 5678).

Concretely, Google introduced a security mechanism based on a cryptographic algorithm named Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) to avoid users and applications other than the browser modifying the Secure Preferences file. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to perform browser hijacking, browser extension fingerprinting, and remote code execution attacks as well as silent browser extensions (un)installation by coding a platform-independent proof-of-concept changeware that exploits the HMAC, allowing for free modification of the Secure Preferences file.

Being deployed with elevated privileges, extensions are given the power to overrule web pages. As a result, web pages often seek to detect the installed extensions, sometimes for benign adoption of their behavior but sometimes as part of privacy-violating user fingerprinting. Researchers have studied a class of attacks that allow detecting extensions by probing for Web Accessible Resources (WARs) via URLs that include public extension IDs. Realizing privacy risks associated with WARs, Firefox has recently moved to randomize a browser extension's ID, prompting the Chrome team to plan for following the same path. However, rather than mitigating the issue, the randomized IDs can in fact exacerbate the extension detection problem, enabling attackers to use a randomized ID as a reliable fingerprint of a user. We study a class of extension revelation attacks, where extensions reveal themselves by injecting their code on web pages. We demonstrate how a combination of revelation and probing can uniquely identify 90% out of all extensions injecting content, in spite of a randomization scheme. We perform a series of large-scale studies to estimate possible implications of both classes of attacks. As a countermeasure, we propose a browser-based mechanism that enables control over which extensions are loaded on which web pages and present a proof of concept implementation which blocks both classes of attacks.","tags":null,"title":"Latex Gloves: Protecting Browser Extensions from Probing and Revelation Attacks","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"0683f5804634b3020a9e3219fd1f3789","permalink":"https://Pica4x6.github.io/service/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/service/","section":"","summary":"Service","tags":null,"title":"Service","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Lara Ortiz-Martin","Pablo Picazo-Sanchez","Pedro Peris-Lopez","Juan Tapiador"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"561cebc7fd6438e6341aa10fb81758eb","permalink":"https://Pica4x6.github.io/publication/ortiz-martin-2018/","publishdate":"2025-08-31T07:16:22.312876Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ortiz-martin-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The proliferation of wearable and implantable medical devices has given rise to an interest in developing security schemes suitable for these systems and the environment in which they operate. One area that has received much attention lately is the use of (human) biological signals as the basis for biometric authentication, identification and the generation of cryptographic keys. The heart signal (e.g., as recorded in an electrocardiogram) has been used by several researchers in the last few years. Specifically, the so-called Inter-Pulse Intervals (IPIs), which is the time between two consecutive heartbeats, have been repeatedly pointed out as a potentially good source of entropy and are at the core of various recent authentication protocols. In this work, we report the results of a large-scale statistical study to determine whether such an assumption is (or not) upheld. For this, we have analyzed 19 public datasets of heart signals from the Physionet repository, spanning electrocardiograms from 1353 subjects sampled at different frequencies and with lengths that vary between a few minutes and several hours. We believe this is the largest dataset on this topic analyzed in the literature. We have then applied a standard battery of randomness tests to the extracted IPIs. Under the algorithms described in this paper and after analyzing these 19 public ECG datasets, our results raise doubts about the use of IPI values as a good source of randomness for cryptographic purposes. This has repercussions both in the security of some of the protocols proposed up to now and also in the design of future IPI-based schemes.","tags":["Authentication","Biometric","Implantable medical devices","Inter-pulse intervals","Privacy","Randomness"],"title":"Heartbeats do not make good pseudo-random number generators: An analysis of the randomness of inter-pulse intervals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elena Pagnin","Carlo Brunetta","Pablo Picazo-Sanchez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"0379bcd87d2be424c55747b7e56af2b0","permalink":"https://Pica4x6.github.io/publication/pagnin-2018/","publishdate":"2025-08-31T07:16:22.796606Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pagnin-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider the problem of privacy-preserving processing of outsourced data in the context of user-customised services.

MEGARA (Multi-Espectrógrafo en GTC de Alta Resolución para Astronomía) is an optical Integral-Field Unit (IFU) and Multi-Object Spectrograph (MOS) designed for the GTC 10.4m telescope in La Palma that is being built by a Consortium led by UCM (Spain) that also includes INAOE (Mexico), IAA-CSIC (Spain), and UPM (Spain). The instrument is currently finishing AIV and will be sent to GTC on November 2016 for its on-sky commissioning on April 2017. The MEGARA IFU fiber bundle (LCB) covers 12.5x11.3 arcsec2 with a spaxel size of 0.62 arcsec while the MEGARA MOS mode allows observing up to 92 objects in a region of 3.5x3.5 arcmin 2 around the IFU. The IFU and MOS modes of MEGARA will provide identical intermediate-to-high spectral resolutions (RFWHM∼6,000, 12,000 and 18,700, respectively for the low-, mid- and high-resolution Volume Phase Holographic gratings) in the range 3700-9800ÅÅ. An x-y mechanism placed at the pseudo-slit position allows (1) exchanging between the two observing modes and (2) focusing the spectrograph for each VPH setup. The spectrograph is a collimator-camera system that has a total of 11 VPHs simultaneously available (out of the 18 VPHs designed and being built) that are placed in the pupil by means of a wheel and an insertion mechanism. The custom-made cryostat hosts a 4kx4k 15-$μ$m CCD. The unique characteristics of MEGARA in terms of throughput and versatility and the unsurpassed collecting are of GTC make of this instrument the most efficient tool to date to analyze astrophysical objects at intermediate spectral resolutions.

In 2011, Jeong and Anh proposed the combined use of an authentication radio frequency identification protocol together with a ticket issuing system for bank services (in J.

In this paper we show that their message generation is weak, because it abuses the XOR operation and the use of a counter, which leaks too much secret protocol information. Our analysis shows important security faults that ruin most of the security properties claimed in the original paper. More precisely, information privacy (via a disclosure and leakage attack) and location privacy (traceability attack) are both compromised. Moreover, an attacker can disrupt the proper working of the system by exploiting the fact that message integrity is not properly checked. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","tags":["Authentication","Banking services","Cryptanalysis","RFID"],"title":"Cryptanalysis of the RNTS system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Picazo-Sanchez","Lara Ortiz-Martin","Pedro Peris-Lopez","Julio C.

The main form of barcode-type RFID device is known as an Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the most popular standard for passive RFID tags is Class-1 Generation-2. In this technology, the information transmitted between devices is through the air, therefore adversaries can eavesdrop these messages passed on the insecure radio channel and finally, the security of the system can be compromised. In this chapter, the authors analyze the security of EPC Class-1 Generation-2 standard, showing its security weaknesses and presenting some possible countermeasures. © 2013, IGI Global.","tags":null,"title":"Security of EPC Class-1","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Picazo-Sanchez","Nasour Bagheri","Pedro Peris-Lopez","Juan E.

RFID technology can offer more intelligent systems and applications, but privacy and security issues have to be addressed before its adoption. This is even more dramatical in healthcare applications where very sensitive information is at stake and patient safety is paramount. In Wu et al. (J. Med. Syst. 37:19, 2013) recently proposed a new RFID authentication protocol for healthcare environments. In this paper we show that this protocol puts location privacy of tag holders at risk, which is a matter of gravest concern and ruins the security of this proposal. To facilitate the implementation of secure RFID-based solutions in the medical sector, we suggest two new applications (authentication and secure messaging) and propose solutions that, in contrast to previous proposals in this field, are fully based on ISO Standards and NIST Security Recommendations. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.","tags":["Healthcare","Privacy","RFID","Standards"],"title":"Two RFID standard-based security protocols for healthcare environments","type":"publication"}]
