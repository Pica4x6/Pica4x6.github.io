Many cryptographic properties rely on the difficulty of generating an adversary who, given an object sampled from one of two classes, correctly distinguishes the class used to generate that object. In the case of cipher suite distinguishing problem, the classes are two different cryptographic primitives. In this paper, we propose a methodology based on machine learning to automatically generate classifiers that can be used by an adversary to solve any distinguishing problem. We discuss the assumptions, a basic approach for improving the advantage of the adversary as well as a phenomenon that we call the “blind spot paradox” . We apply our methodology to generate distinguishers for the NIST (DRBG) cipher suite problem. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the distinguishers might statistically have some advantage to distinguish between the DRBG used.

The acceptance of extensions in current browsers is unquestionable. For instance, Chrome's official extension repository has more than 63,000 extensions, with some of them having more than 10M users. When installed, extensions are pushed into an internal queue within the browser. The order in which each extension executes depends on a number of factors, including their relative installation times. In this paper, we demonstrate how this order can be exploited by an unprivileged malicious extension (i.e., one with no more permissions than those already assigned when accessing web content) to get access to any private information that other extensions have previously introduced. We propose a solution that does not require modifying the core browser engine, since it is implemented as another browser extension. We prove that our approach effectively protects the user against usual attackers (i.e., any other installed extension) as well as against strong attackers having access to the effects of all installed extensions (i.e., knowing who did what). We also prove soundness and robustness of our approach under reasonable assumptions.","tags":["\"browser extensions\"","\"chrome\"","\"malware\"","\"privacy\"","\"web security\""],"title":"After you, please: browser extensions order attacks and countermeasures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lara Ortiz-Martin","Pablo Picazo-Sanchez","Pedro Peris-Lopez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"91068e4624f2fef29c4c63dcc424fddd","permalink":"https://Pica4x6.github.io/publication/ortiz-2019-a/","publishdate":"2021-09-06T05:09:16.652146Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ortiz-2019-a/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years many authors have explored the use of biological signals for security issues.

In this article, we demonstrate that the choice of the IPI bits used to date may not be the most correct (e.g., the combination of bits 2638 are much better that the common assumed 5678).

Concretely, Google introduced a security mechanism based on a cryptographic algorithm named Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) to avoid users and applications other than the browser modifying the Secure Preferences file. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to perform browser hijacking, browser extension fingerprinting, and remote code execution attacks as well as silent browser extensions (un)installation by coding a platform-independent proof-of-concept changeware that exploits the HMAC, allowing for free modification of the Secure Preferences file.

We first show that it is impossible, in general, to correct the differences between the IPIs derived from two captured electrocardiogram (ECG) signals when using only error correction techniques, thus being impossible to corroborate previous claims on the feasibility of this approach. Then, we provide a large-scale evaluation of the proposed method (run-time monitor and fuzzy extractor) over 19 public databases from the Physionet repository containing heart signals. The results clearly show the practicality of our proposal achieving a 91% of synchronization probability for healthy individuals. Additionally, we also conduct an experiment to check how long the sensors should record the heart signal in order to generate tokens of 32, 64 and 128 bits. Contrarily to what it is usually assumed (6, 12, and 24 s for individuals with a heart rate of 80 beats-per-minute), the sensors have to wait 13, 28 and 56.5 s on median, respectively, to derive the same token from both sensors.","tags":["\"biometrics\"","\"body sensor networks\"","\"privacy\"","\"security\""],"title":"Feasibility analysis of Inter-Pulse Intervals based solutions for cryptographic token generation by two electrocardiogram sensors","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"021619127fc6d2ae48d7bb0344bef8cc","permalink":"https://Pica4x6.github.io/industry/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/industry/","section":"","summary":"Industry Career","tags":null,"title":"Industry","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Alexander Sjosten","Steven Van Acker","Pablo Picazo-Sanchez","Andrei Sabelfeld"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"d593d381874bef54a6888eeb979eb229","permalink":"https://Pica4x6.github.io/publication/sjosten-2019/","publishdate":"2021-09-06T05:09:17.439831Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sjosten-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Browser extensions enable rich experience for the users of today's web. Being deployed with elevated privileges, extensions are given the power to overrule web pages. As a result, web pages often seek to detect the installed extensions, sometimes for benign adoption of their behavior but sometimes as part of privacy-violating user fingerprinting. Researchers have studied a class of attacks that allow detecting extensions by probing for Web Accessible Resources (WARs) via URLs that include public extension IDs. Realizing privacy risks associated with WARs, Firefox has recently moved to randomize a browser extension's ID, prompting the Chrome team to plan for following the same path. However, rather than mitigating the issue, the randomized IDs can in fact exacerbate the extension detection problem, enabling attackers to use a randomized ID as a reliable fingerprint of a user. We study a class of extension revelation attacks, where extensions reveal themselves by injecting their code on web pages. We demonstrate how a combination of revelation and probing can uniquely identify 90% out of all extensions injecting content, in spite of a randomization scheme. We perform a series of large-scale studies to estimate possible implications of both classes of attacks. As a countermeasure, we propose a browser-based mechanism that enables control over which extensions are loaded on which web pages and present a proof of concept implementation which blocks both classes of attacks.","tags":null,"title":"Latex Gloves: Protecting Browser Extensions from Probing and Revelation Attacks","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"0683f5804634b3020a9e3219fd1f3789","permalink":"https://Pica4x6.github.io/service/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/service/","section":"","summary":"Service","tags":null,"title":"Service","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Lara Ortiz-Martin","Pablo Picazo-Sanchez","Pedro Peris-Lopez","Juan Tapiador"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"561cebc7fd6438e6341aa10fb81758eb","permalink":"https://Pica4x6.github.io/publication/ortiz-martin-2018/","publishdate":"2021-09-06T05:09:14.883695Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ortiz-martin-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The proliferation of wearable and implantable medical devices has given rise to an interest in developing security schemes suitable for these systems and the environment in which they operate. One area that has received much attention lately is the use of (human) biological signals as the basis for biometric authentication, identification and the generation of cryptographic keys. The heart signal (e.g., as recorded in an electrocardiogram) has been used by several researchers in the last few years. Specifically, the so-called Inter-Pulse Intervals (IPIs), which is the time between two consecutive heartbeats, have been repeatedly pointed out as a potentially good source of entropy and are at the core of various recent authentication protocols. In this work, we report the results of a large-scale statistical study to determine whether such an assumption is (or not) upheld. For this, we have analyzed 19 public datasets of heart signals from the Physionet repository, spanning electrocardiograms from 1353 subjects sampled at different frequencies and with lengths that vary between a few minutes and several hours. We believe this is the largest dataset on this topic analyzed in the literature. We have then applied a standard battery of randomness tests to the extracted IPIs. Under the algorithms described in this paper and after analyzing these 19 public ECG datasets, our results raise doubts about the use of IPI values as a good source of randomness for cryptographic purposes. This has repercussions both in the security of some of the protocols proposed up to now and also in the design of future IPI-based schemes.","tags":["\"authentication\"","\"biometric\"","\"implantable medical devices\"","\"inter-pulse intervals\"","\"privacy\"","\"randomness\""],"title":"Heartbeats do not make good pseudo-random number generators: An analysis of the randomness of inter-pulse intervals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elena Pagnin","Carlo Brunetta","Pablo Picazo-Sanchez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"0379bcd87d2be424c55747b7e56af2b0","permalink":"https://Pica4x6.github.io/publication/pagnin-2018/","publishdate":"2021-09-06T05:09:15.666459Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pagnin-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider the problem of privacy-preserving processing of outsourced data in the context of user-customised services.

MEGARA (Multi-Espectrógrafo en GTC de Alta Resolución para Astronomía) is an optical Integral-Field Unit (IFU) and Multi-Object Spectrograph (MOS) designed for the GTC 10.4m telescope in La Palma that is being built by a Consortium led by UCM (Spain) that also includes INAOE (Mexico), IAA-CSIC (Spain), and UPM (Spain). The instrument is currently finishing AIV and will be sent to GTC on November 2016 for its on-sky commissioning on April 2017. The MEGARA IFU fiber bundle (LCB) covers 12.5x11.3 arcsec2 with a spaxel size of 0.62 arcsec while the MEGARA MOS mode allows observing up to 92 objects in a region of 3.5x3.5 arcmin 2 around the IFU. The IFU and MOS modes of MEGARA will provide identical intermediate-to-high spectral resolutions (RFWHM∼6,000, 12,000 and 18,700, respectively for the low-, mid- and high-resolution Volume Phase Holographic gratings) in the range 3700-9800ÅÅ. An x-y mechanism placed at the pseudo-slit position allows (1) exchanging between the two observing modes and (2) focusing the spectrograph for each VPH setup. The spectrograph is a collimator-camera system that has a total of 11 VPHs simultaneously available (out of the 18 VPHs designed and being built) that are placed in the pupil by means of a wheel and an insertion mechanism. The custom-made cryostat hosts a 4kx4k 15-$μ$m CCD. The unique characteristics of MEGARA in terms of throughput and versatility and the unsurpassed collecting are of GTC make of this instrument the most efficient tool to date to analyze astrophysical objects at intermediate spectral resolutions.

We report experimental results with a prototype implementation demonstrating the suitability of our proposed solution.","tags":["\"attribute-based encryption\"","\"privacy\"","\"wearable sensors\"","\"wireless body area networks (wban)\"","\"ehealth security\""],"title":"Secure publish-subscribe protocols for heterogeneous medical wireless body area networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Picazo-Sanchez","Lara Ortiz-Martin","Pedro Peris-Lopez","Julio Cesar Hernandez-Castro"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"b0d088afb57d0f6572942c060d1f58c7","permalink":"https://Pica4x6.github.io/publication/picazo-sanchez-2013-a/","publishdate":"2021-09-06T05:09:16.245103Z","relpermalink":"/publication/picazo-sanchez-2013-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Internet of Things is a paradigm that enables communication between different devices connected to a local network or to Internet. Identification and communication between sensors used in Internet of Things and devices like smart-phones or tablets are established using radio frequency identification technology. However, this technology still has several security and privacy issues because of its severe computational constraints. In 2011, Jeong and Anh proposed the combined use of an authentication radio frequency identification protocol together with a ticket issuing system for bank services (in J. Supercomput. 55:307, 2011). In this paper we show that their message generation is weak, because it abuses the XOR operation and the use of a counter, which leaks too much secret protocol information. Our analysis shows important security faults that ruin most of the security properties claimed in the original paper. More precisely, information privacy (via a disclosure and leakage attack) and location privacy (traceability attack) are both compromised. Moreover, an attacker can disrupt the proper working of the system by exploiting the fact that message integrity is not properly checked. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","tags":["\"authentication\"","\"banking services\"","\"cryptanalysis\"","\"rfid\""],"title":"Cryptanalysis of the RNTS system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Picazo-Sanchez","Nasour Bagheri","Pedro Peris-Lopez","Juan E.

RFID technology can offer more intelligent systems and applications, but privacy and security issues have to be addressed before its adoption. This is even more dramatical in healthcare applications where very sensitive information is at stake and patient safety is paramount. In Wu et al. (J. Med. Syst. 37:19, 2013) recently proposed a new RFID authentication protocol for healthcare environments. In this paper we show that this protocol puts location privacy of tag holders at risk, which is a matter of gravest concern and ruins the security of this proposal. To facilitate the implementation of secure RFID-based solutions in the medical sector, we suggest two new applications (authentication and secure messaging) and propose solutions that, in contrast to previous proposals in this field, are fully based on ISO Standards and NIST Security Recommendations. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.","tags":["\"healthcare\"","\"privacy\"","\"rfid\"","\"standards\""],"title":"Two RFID standard-based security protocols for healthcare environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Picazo-Sanchez","Lara Ortiz-Martin","Pedro Peris-Lopez","Julio C.

The main form of barcode-type RFID device is known as an Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the most popular standard for passive RFID tags is Class-1 Generation-2. In this technology, the information transmitted between devices is through the air, therefore adversaries can eavesdrop these messages passed on the insecure radio channel and finally, the security of the system can be compromised.
